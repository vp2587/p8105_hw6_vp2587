# Problem 1

**The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You
can read their accompanying article here.**

**Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas,
TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race.
Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem,
limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be
sure that victim_age is numeric.**

``` r
homicide_df = read_csv("homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) %>%
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) %>% 
  select(-city, -state)
```

**For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply
the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence
interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.**

``` r
baltimore_glm =  
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  glm(
    solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
    data = ., family = binomial()
  )

baltimore_glm  %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term           estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>             <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale    0.426    0.324     0.558

**Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.**

``` r
city_glm =
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  mutate(
    fit = map(data, ~ glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
                          data = ., family = binomial())),
    tidy_fit = map(.x = fit, ~broom::tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, tidy_fit) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_fit) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
city_glm
```

    ## # A tibble: 47 × 4
    ## # Groups:   city_state [47]
    ##    city_state      estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##    <chr>              <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ##  1 Albuquerque, NM    1.77     0.825     3.76

    ##  3 Baltimore, MD      0.426    0.324     0.558
    ##  4 Baton Rouge, LA    0.381    0.204     0.684
    ##  5 Birmingham, AL     0.870    0.571     1.31 
    ##  6 Boston, MA         0.674    0.353     1.28 
    ##  7 Buffalo, NY        0.521    0.288     0.936
    ##  8 Charlotte, NC      0.884    0.551     1.39 
    ##  9 Chicago, IL        0.410    0.336     0.501
    ## 10 Cincinnati, OH     0.400    0.231     0.667
    ## # ℹ 37 more rows

**Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.**

``` r
city_glm %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(city_state, estimate), y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7)) +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted odds ratio of solved homicides between male and female victims",
    x = "City",
    y = "Adjusted odds ratio (male vs female victims)"
  )
```

majority of odds ratios are less than one, suggesting that cases female
homicide victims in these cities are less often resolved. Of these
cities, the odds ratio is statistically significant, implying sufficient
evidence of a true difference in case disposition across sexes. Three
cities report an odds ratio above 1, but they are not statistically
significant since the lower bound of the interval is below 1.

# Problem 2

**For this problem, we’ll use the Central Park weather data we’ve seen
elsewhere. The code chunk below will import these data from the
p8105.datasets package.**

**The bootstrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a
parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down
distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a
simple linear regression with tmax as the response with tmin and prcp as
the predictors, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities
estimated from these data:**

- 𝑟̂ 2

- 𝛽̂ 1𝛽̂ 2

**Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your
estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap
estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95%
confidence interval for 𝑟̂ 2 and 𝛽̂ 1𝛽̂ 2.**

**Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting 𝑟̂ 2 from a fitted
regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should
help in computing 𝛽̂ 1𝛽̂ 2.**

``` r
set.seed(123)
weather_boot = 
  weather_df %>% 
  drop_na(tmax, tmin, prcp) %>%
  bootstrap(n = 5000, id = "strap_id") %>% 
  mutate(
    fit = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin + prcp, data = .x)),
    glance = map(fit, broom::glance),
    tidy = map(fit, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    r2_weather = map_dbl(glance, "r.squared"),
    beta_ratio = map_dbl(tidy, ~ {
      b1 = .x %>% 
        filter(term == "tmin") %>% pull(estimate)
      b2 = .x %>% 
        filter(term == "prcp") %>% pull(estimate)
      b1 / b2
    })
  ) %>% 
  select(strap_id, r2_weather, beta_ratio)

weather_long =
  weather_boot %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("r2_weather", "beta_ratio"),
    names_to = "parameter",
    values_to = "estimate"

  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +

    title = "Bootstrap distributions for r^2 and β1/β2",
    x = "Bootstrap estimate",
    y = "Count"
